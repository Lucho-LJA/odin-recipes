        <p>
            Shrimp ceviche or ceviche de camaron is one of the 
            most popular Ecuadorian ceviches. Ceviches, also known as 
            cebiches (both spellings are acceptable), are very popular 
            all around Ecuador, but especially at the beach. One of 
            the great things about this type of Ecuadorian ceviche is 
            that the shrimp are already cooked.
