                <ul>
                    <li>2 lb beef steaks skirt steak, flank or hanger type steaks are a good choice, for a higher end version of this dish you can also use sirloin, ny style, ribeye or tenderloin steaks</li>
                    <li>8-12 garlic cloves crushed</li>
                    <li>1 tbs ground cumin</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix the crushed garlic, cumin, salt and pepper together to make a marinade for the meat.</li>
                    <li>Rub the garlic cumin marinade on the thin steaks and let marinate for a couple of hours</li>
                    <li>Grill or fry the steaks over high heat to desired doneness; since they are relatively thin they wonâ€™t take too long to cook.</li>
                    <li>Serve the steaks with a crispy fried egg or two on top and with the additional side dishes of rice, homemade fries, fried ripe plantains, 
                        tomato and onion curtido or your choice of salad, plus avocado slices and aji criollo. You can mix and match the sides according to your 
                        preference.</li>                    
                </ol>
